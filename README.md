# 💬 ChatRoomApp

**ChatRoomApp** is a C++ project that simulates a multi-user chatroom from scratch. It's designed as an advanced exercise to practice modern C++17 features, focusing on real-world concepts and clean architecture.

## ✨ Objective

Build a console-based application where multiple users can register, authenticate, and exchange different types of messages (text, images, etc.) in a simulated chatroom. The project also features a message history, special commands (like `/help`, `/whisper`, `/stats`, etc.), and admin roles.

## 📚 Key Concepts Practiced

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Use of `variant`, `optional`, `tuple`, `pair`, and `structured bindings`
- Time and date handling with `chrono`
- Modular code organization with **CMake**
- Console I/O and in-memory data simulation
- Basic communication simulation (e.g., future socket support)
- Clean Code principles and modern naming conventions

## 🚀 Features

- User registration and login with password
- Support for sending different types of messages (text, image, etc.)
- Simulated chat history with timestamps
- Admin user roles with special privileges
- Support for commands like `/help`, `/whisper`, `/save`, `/exit`
- Optional persistence through file-based storage
- Message statistics and user actions tracking

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Language: **C++17**
- Build system: **CMake**
- Platform: Linux (Pop!_OS / Ubuntu)
- Compiler: `g++`
- Style: Modern Clean Code practices and naming conventions

## 🛠 Work in Progress

This project is currently under development as an educational exercise. Upcoming features include full socket communication, a more advanced CLI interface, and persistent user/message storage.
